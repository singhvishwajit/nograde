				<p>Hi there, I am Vishwajit Singh, founder of NoGrade Academy.</p>
				<p>I started NoGrade Academy out of my own curiosity to learn about and refine my understanding of the world.</p>
				<p>I believe education is about getting people to think for themselves and therefore, the insights and ideas shared on NoGrade Academy do not constitute absolute truths but rather provide a perspective for you to chew on and to figure out for yourself what you think is the case.</p>
				<p>NoGrade Academy's mission is to share insights and ideas on better navigating your life and career.</p>			
				<p>If you are interested in learning how to think, understanding and growing yourself, and focusing on adding value to the life of others through your work and projects, check out the available courses and let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>
				<p>I am currently bootstrapping this initiative and I rely on your support to add new courses and update the old ones as needed. I am not associated with any organization, corporation or university.</p>
				<p>Please support NoGrade Academy by either sharing the available courses with others or if you have the means through financial contribution option available on our support page.</p>
				<p>In case you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.</p>
				<p>Happy learning!</p>
				<p>Vishwajit</p>
